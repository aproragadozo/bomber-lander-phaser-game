My first IT experience was programming in BASIC, and this is as much as I remember the first game we've collectively coded in class: a lander that drops bombs on a cityscape to raze it and either land if successful, or be destroyed when it hits a tower.
This time, I'm using PhaserJS.
I started experimenting with Claude Code – I've done the basic PhaserJS setup by myself, and had a working game before tweaking it with the AI assistant.
I'd like to polish this into a proper online game – watch this space.
